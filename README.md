# FRED's Backpack
A collection of tools and resources for new Front-end Developers

## Version 0.1

## Contributing

As of **v0.1** it's pretty scrappy â€” either fork it, add a new resource, and submit a pull request, or just post a comment in [#1](/../../issues/1), or submit an issue with the `resource addition` label.

If you're going the route of a pull request, please follow the following rules when listing a resource:

### Order of listings

Resources are listed based on category in the following order:

1.  Resource is free and available on any OS
2.  Resource is free and only available on a certain OS
3.  Resource has a cost but has some sort of free option and available on any OS
4.  Resource has a cost but has some sort of free option and only available on a certain OS
5.  Resource has a cost and available on any OS
6.  Resource has a cost and only available on a certain OS

If there are multiple listings any of of the above qualifications they are listed in alphabetical order based on the first letter of the first word in the resources title.

## To Do:

- [ ] Right now the backpacks are hosted on S3 and packed manually, but I need to figure out a better way to handle this
    - [ ] Allow auto-build with checklist of what user wants to include
- [ ] More dynamic way to add tools and resources
