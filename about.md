### Why "FRED"?

**FRED** is short for **FR**ont-**E**nd **D**eveloper. FRED could be anyone though — woman, man, child, senior citizen — anyone who uses front-end web technologies to build things!

Howdy! I created **FRED's Backpack** because after teaching several introductory web development workshops I found myself compiling lists of resources for those trying to get started, over and over again. I figured I should just make a single list, an open source list, that can grow and develop as more resources become available and tools change. I figured while I was at it I might as well provide people with a package of the tools they'll need to get started too. My hope is that this will help people who are just getting started, and will grow to be something that is maintained by whomever wants to contribute.

Please let me know if you have questions or comments by emailing me at [fredsbackpack@gmail.com](mailto:fredsbackpack@gmail.com), tweeting me at [@fredsbackpack](https://twitter.com/fredsbackpack), or submitting an issue at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/poopsplat/fredsbackpack).
